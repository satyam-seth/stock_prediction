# stock_prediction
In this project, I have trained a Linear Regression Machine Learning model that predicts any stock price and I have also created the desktop application and flask-based API for the same.

## How to run Flask API -
1.Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all python packages on your system which is listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/satyam-seth/stock_prediction/blob/master/API/requirements.txt) file.

2.Open cmd or terminal

3.Go to file location were [main.py](https://github.com/satyam-seth/stock_prediction/blob/master/API/main.py) is located

4.Run the command *python main.py*

5.Open your browser and open url http://127.0.0.1:5000/[stock_name]/[split_size]/[days]
